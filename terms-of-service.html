                    personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York.
                    These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of New York, without respect to its
                    conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction
                    involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the
                    substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation
                    and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 13.2 and preempts all state laws to the
                    fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is determined to not apply to any issue that arises from
                    or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the
                    law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
                    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal

                    we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a

                    rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required
                    to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that New York, New York is the proper and exclusive forum for

                resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by

                Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be
                conducted in the U.S. county where you live or New York, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise. If
                you are using our Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS
                filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the
                arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert
                and other witnesses. If you are an individual using our Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS
                may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully
                obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of
                arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses;
                and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in
                arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
                resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
                competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court
                or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation,
                applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all
                or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible
                for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or
                any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including
